# Mark_Entry_Portal
 This is a portal to enter the marks of the individual student for their periodical test1, periodical test 2 and semester. In periodical test 1 the requirement is to create a separate column to enter CO1, CO2, CO3 and the most important thing is to automatically calculate the  CO1%, CO2%, CO3% and co1_attainment, co2_attainment automatically based on the input  entered in the field. For PT2 get CO3, CO4, CO5 and calculate CO3%, CO4%, CO5% and co3_attainment, co4_attainment, co5_attainment based on the input field automatically. Additionally calculate the PO attainment based on the input data for P1,PT2 and Semester.
